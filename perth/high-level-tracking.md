name: High Level Tracking
---

Each year the overarching high level tasks are tracked using a kanban board, with buckets/columns for each month leading up to the event. At the start of the year, some months may be grouped together as there's a bit less going on then, but closer to the event (typically 4 months prior), months get their own individual columns. An example of the columns/buckets with an October conference is below.

- March / April
- May / June
- July
- August
- September
- October
- Post Conference

Referencing the previous year's high level tracking, new tasks can be created for the relevant time periods. If the conference is at a different time of year, adjust the due dates.
